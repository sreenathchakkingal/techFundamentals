Template method design pattern is to define an algorithm as skeleton of operations and leave the details
 to be implemented by the child classes. The overall structure and sequence of the algorithm is preserved by the parent class.
In template method pattern,we have a preset structure method called template method which consists of steps.
This steps can be abstract method which will be implemented by its subclasses. Used popularly in framework development.

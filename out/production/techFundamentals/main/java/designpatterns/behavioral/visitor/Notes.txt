Where Would I Use This Pattern?
The pattern should be used when you have distinct and unrelated operations to perform across a structure of objects.
This avoids adding in code throughout your object structure that is better kept seperate, so it encourages cleaner code.
You may want to run operations against a set of objects with different interfaces.  Visitors are also valuable if you
have to perform a number of unrelated operations across the classes.
